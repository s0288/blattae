## We are a small team of behavioural psychology and data science professionals digitalising therapies to help people realise their potential. 
### Today, an average female German citizen enjoys 67.5 healthy life years <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Healthy_life_years,_2015_(years)_YB17.png" title="Eurostat">(Eurostat)</a>. We build small tools to help raise that number to 100.

This is an incomplete list of projects we are working on and learning about (updated every few months).

### Fasting:
Fasting is one of the world's oldest medical treatment methods. Fasting has been shown to be effective in the <a href="http://fastingmovie.com/" title="Fasting">treatment of various cardiovascular diseases</a> such as arthritis, hypertension, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and, more generally, insulin resistance. We are especially interested in the current research around <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/377/eaai8700.short" title="FMDs">Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)</a> and how virtual assistants can support patients in adhering to a FMD.

### Intelligent patient support:
When it comes to our personal health, we have no roadmap and very little understanding. While modern science may know a lot about genetics or what we're born with, experts don't have the means to help us identify and modify unhealthy and life-shortening habits. Most often, experts don't even know how our personal choices each day can limit, or open, our future.
We want a solution that shows us where we are headed in terms of our health, with clear explanations on our risks and opportunities. We want a guide that helps us navigate about which paths lead to a long and healthy life, or a shortened and painful one.

### Care for the elderly:
In Japanese culture, *ikigai* is a concept that means 'a reason for being'. <a href="http://www.shenjiva.com/709.full.pdf" title="ikigai"> Researchers in Japan</a> showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among subjects who did not find a sense of ikigai. We look for light-weight, technological solutions that help (elderly) people find their ikigai.
