## We are a small team of behavioural psychology and data science professionals digitising lifestyle interventions to help people realise their potential. 
### Today, an average female German citizen enjoys 67.5 healthy life years <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Healthy_life_years,_2015_(years)_YB17.png" title="Eurostat">(Eurostat)</a>. We build small tools to help raise that number to 100.

This is an incomplete list of projects we are working on and learning about (updated every few months).

### Ketogenic diets:
The “keto” in ketogenic diet comes from the fact that it makes the body produce small fuel molecules called “ketones”. This is an alternative fuel for the body, used when blood sugar (glucose) is in short supply. On a ketogenic diet, your entire body switches its fuel supply to run almost entirely on fat. Insulin levels become very low, and fat burning increases dramatically.
As <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124716305769" title="Keto and MS">recent science suggests</a>, a ketogenic diet may be an effective intervention in the treatment of diseases such as diabetes type 2, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

### Fasting:
Fasting is one of the world's oldest medical treatment methods. Fasting has been shown to be effective in the <a href="http://fastingmovie.com/" title="Fasting">treatment of various cardiovascular diseases</a> such as arthritis, hypertension, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and, more generally, insulin resistance. We are especially interested in the current research around <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/377/eaai8700.short" title="FMDs">Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115004623" title="trf">time-restricted feeding</a> and how virtual assistants can support patients in adhering to their intervention.

### Intelligent patient support:
When it comes to our personal health, we have no roadmap and very little understanding. While modern science may know a lot about genetics or what we're born with, experts don't have the means to help us identify and modify unhealthy and life-shortening habits. Most often, experts don't even know how our personal choices each day can limit, or open, our future.
We want a solution that shows us where we are headed in terms of our health, with clear explanations on our risks and opportunities. We want a guide that helps us navigate about which paths lead to a long and healthy life, or a shortened and painful one.

### Care for the elderly:
In Japanese culture, *ikigai* is a concept that means 'a reason for being'. <a href="http://www.shenjiva.com/709.full.pdf" title="ikigai"> Researchers in Japan</a> showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among subjects who did not find a sense of ikigai. We look for light-weight, technological solutions that help older populations find their ikigai.
