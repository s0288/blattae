## We are a small team of behavioural psychology and data science professionals developing tools to help people realise their potential. 
### Today, an average female German citizen enjoys 67.5 healthy life years <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Healthy_life_years,_2015_(years)_YB17.png" title="Eurostat">(Eurostat)</a>. We build small tools to help raise that number to 100.

This is an incomplete list of projects we are working on and learning about (updated every few months).

### Fasting:
Fasting is one of the world's oldest medical treatment methods. Fasting has been shown to be effective in the <a href="http://fastingmovie.com/" title="Fasting">treatment of various cardiovascular diseases</a> such as hypertension, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and, more generally, insulin resistance. We work on an AI assistant that supports you in keeping up your fasting regimen.

### Care for the elderly:
In Japanese culture, *ikigai* is a concept that means 'a reason for being'. <a href="http://www.shenjiva.com/709.full.pdf" title="ikigai"> Researchers in Japan</a> showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among subjects who did not find a sense of ikigai. We look for light-weight, technological solutions that help (elderly) people find their ikigai.

### Your AI companion:
With digital, evidence-based interventions on the rise, a patient's life can be greatly enhanced by making accessibility and adherence to these interventions easier. An AI companion that identifies the right intervention and helps the patient stick to it, can significantly increase the patient's expected healthy life years.
