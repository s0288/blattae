## We are a small team of behavioural psychology and data science professionals digitalising therapies to help people realise their potential. 
### Today, an average female German citizen enjoys 67.5 healthy life years <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Healthy_life_years,_2015_(years)_YB17.png" title="Eurostat">(Eurostat)</a>. We build small tools to help raise that number to 100.

This is an incomplete list of projects we are working on and learning about (updated every few months).

### Fasting:
Fasting is one of the world's oldest medical treatment methods. Fasting has been shown to be effective in the <a href="http://fastingmovie.com/" title="Fasting">treatment of various cardiovascular diseases</a> such as arthritis, hypertension, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and, more generally, insulin resistance. We are especially interested in the current research around <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/377/eaai8700.short" title="FMDs">Fasting-Mimicking Diets (FMDs)</a> and how virtual assistants can support patients in adhering to a FMD.

### Care for the elderly:
In Japanese culture, *ikigai* is a concept that means 'a reason for being'. <a href="http://www.shenjiva.com/709.full.pdf" title="ikigai"> Researchers in Japan</a> showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among subjects who did not find a sense of ikigai. We look for light-weight, technological solutions that help (elderly) people find their ikigai.

### Patient support:
With digital, evidence-based interventions on the rise, a patient's life can be greatly enhanced by making accessibility and adherence to these interventions easier. Many people are currently looking into the field of natural language generation. However, most are focused on building linear decision-tree solutions, without a real intention of providing truly personalised advise. We believe that a different way forward is required. We don't need more chatbots that people have no interest in communicating with. Rather, a solution is needed that patients truly enjoy engaging with and that helps them become a healthier version of themselves.
